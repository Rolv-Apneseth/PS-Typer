However, a monopoly game lasts about 20-25 turns, so according to Wolfram Alpha that's about a 7% chance of rolling three doubles in the whole game.",

Show respect for those in power, but don't follow them blindly. Judge with logic and reason, but comment not. Consider none your superior whatever their rank or station in life.

    "Her life is architected, elegant and angular, a beauty to behold, and mine is a stew, a juicy, sloppy mess of ingredients and feelings and emotions, too much salt and spice, too much anxiety, always a little dribbling down the front of my shirt. But have you tasted it? It's delicious.",

    "Nikki, the name we finally gave my younger daughter, is not an abbreviation; it was a compromise I reached with her father.

    "Her first name was India - she was never able to get used to it. It seemed to her that her parents must have been thinking of someone else when they named her.

I had lost what seemed like a lot of time.",
    "Nobody died that year. Nobody prospered. There were no births or marriages. Seventeen reverent satires were written - disrupting a cliche and, presumably, creating a genre.
